## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

Grid Container and Grid Items: I learned how to define a grid container and specify grid items within it. The grid container serves as the parent element, while the grid items are the child elements that are placed within the grid.

Grid Rows and Columns: I learned how to set up grid rows and columns using the grid-template-rows and grid-template-columns properties. This allowed me to specify the size and layout of rows and columns in the grid.

Grid Placement: I learned how to position grid items within the grid using properties like grid-row and grid-column. These properties allow for precise control over where each item is placed.

Responsive Design with Media Queries: I discovered how to create responsive grid layouts by using media queries. With media queries, I could adapt the grid layout based on different screen sizes or devices, providing a consistent user experience across various devices.

Grid Gaps: I learned how to add gaps between grid items using the gap property. This feature helps in creating visually pleasing and well-spaced grid layouts.

Overall, working on this project provided me with a solid foundation in CSS Grid, enabling me to create dynamic and responsive grid-based designs. I now have a better understanding of how to structure and arrange content using grids, giving me more control and flexibility in my future web development projects
